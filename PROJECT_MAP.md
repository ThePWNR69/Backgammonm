# Backgammon Legacy project map

Use this map before editing so future updates stay targeted.

- `game/` — rules/state/moves only. Contains Backgammon, Mahbouseh and Tawla 31 domain behaviour. No UI resources.
- `ai/` — AI strategies and move selection.
- `progression/` — persistent XP/Gold and match reward calculation.
- `cosmetics/` — board/checker/dice/UI-theme registries and unlock metadata.
- `rendering/` — BoardMap, BoardGeometry, board/checker rendering, hit regions and animations.
- `animation/` — interchangeable checker movement styles.
- `boss/` — boss definitions/catalog for future progression.
- `ui/` — activities and screen orchestration. `GameActivity` owns the 510×280 approved gameplay composition but not game rules.
- `res/drawable-nodpi/premium_*` — Classic Burgundy gameplay chrome assets and state artwork.
- `assets/cosmetics/boards/` — canonical 2048×977 production board images.
- `design/reference/CLASSIC_BURGUNDY_APPROVED.png` — visual source of truth for the gameplay screen.
- `APPROVED_GAMEPLAY_LAYOUT.md` — locked coordinates/proportions measured from that reference.

For visual-only gameplay updates, normally edit only `cosmetics/`, `ui/GameActivity`, relevant `res/drawable*` assets, and the selected board asset. Do not touch `game/`, `progression/`, AI or BoardMap unless the requested feature actually changes them.
