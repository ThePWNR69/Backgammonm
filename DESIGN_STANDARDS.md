# Backgammon Legacy — locked production standards (v1.4.4)

These are architecture rules, not per-theme preferences. Future boards/checkers must follow them automatically.

## 1. One permanent invisible BoardMap

Gameplay geometry lives in `rendering/BoardMap.java` and is projected by `BoardGeometry.java`.

The map owns:
- all 24 point locations
- stack anchors
- bar anchors
- bear-off tray anchors
- touch/hit regions
- movement/animation start and end positions

Board artwork never supplies gameplay coordinates.

## 2. Master board artwork

Production board size: **2048 × 977 px** (aspect ~**2.096:1**).

Every board image must retain the same:
- 24 triangle positions
- point bases and tips
- centre bar
- left/right trays
- playing-field rectangle
- overall aspect ratio

Only materials, colours, ornamentation and lighting may change.

Runtime protection: `StaticBoardRenderer` accepts a production board only when it matches the master dimensions exactly. An invalid board falls back to the debug renderer rather than silently misaligning gameplay.

### Canonical pixel regions
- Field envelope: x **236–1840**, y **58–916**
- Left tray: x **78–219**
- Right tray: x **1849–1976**
- Bar: x **996–1085**
- Point height: measured per triangle from its base to its apex (approximately **358–392 px**)

## 3. Layering

Runtime stack:
1. premium tabletop/background artwork
2. selected static board image
3. invisible BoardMap (logic/hitboxes)
4. checkers
5. dice
6. move indicators
7. movement/dice animations

Board art contains no live checker/dice state.

## 4. Checker sizing

Source checker canvas: **512 × 512 px**.
Target visible checker content: **448 px diameter**, centred.

On-screen checker size comes only from `BoardGeometry`. Theme artwork cannot make one set larger/smaller.
`AssetTextureRepository.visibleBounds()` trims source transparent padding at runtime before fitting artwork to the same render square.

## 5. Stack standard

- Up to five physical checker positions are shown on a point.
- Five visible checkers finish at approximately the point tip.
- 6+ uses a count badge instead of extending into the centre.

## 6. Shared previews

Gameplay, Store and Customise use the same board image, BoardMap and checker renderer. No hand-positioned preview pieces and no alternate preview geometry.

## 7. Visual target

The approved premium gameplay reference is the production target for Classic Walnut:
- deep walnut case with physical bevel/depth
- black leather playing surface
- cream + walnut points
- polished ivory/walnut checkers
- brass/gold trim
- dark emerald luxury tabletop
- dark brown player panels and emerald/gold status/action controls
- compact UI so the board remains the focus

## 8. New board workflow

1. Start from the 2048×977 canonical template/regions above.
2. Never move any gameplay geometry.
3. Redesign only the materials/art treatment.
4. Export to `app/src/main/assets/cosmetics/boards/<id>/board.webp`.
5. Register the theme in `CosmeticCatalog`.
6. Verify with in-game **Show Board Map** before release.

## 9. New checker workflow

1. Use a 512×512 transparent canvas.
2. Centre the visible disc to the standard bounds.
3. Export `light.webp` and `dark.webp`.
4. Register the set in `CosmeticCatalog`.
5. Confirm it renders the same diameter as every existing set.

## 10. GitHub browser upload limit

The distributable source package must remain below **100 files**. Reuse assets and render previews from production assets rather than adding duplicate preview files.

## Triangle-centred checker placement

Checker X positions are **not** a generic column centre. Each production point has measured base-left, base-right and apex coordinates. At every checker slot Y, the renderer interpolates both sloping triangle edges and places the checker at their exact midpoint. The same rule applies to landing previews, move indicators and animation endpoints. Future board artwork must preserve these triangle vertices.
